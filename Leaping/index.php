				One Leaping Lemur is the perfect book for learning how to to count. It is the debut book from Clark
				Brettell. The book is themed around some leaping lemurs and is a nice light introduction to counting up
				to 10.
				Before children are even able to read they can sing a long with the song which is included via a QR code
				as pictured.

				It takes a few days before Amazon print and dispatch the book. Despite this small snag,
				the book has been positively reviewed by early customers. Amazon tend to be more reliable
				when it comes to delivery, and the customer service is great for any issues you may encounter when
				waiting for the book to arrive.
